    <h1>Our Indigineous Animals</h1>
    <p>Indigenous animals are species that are native to a particular region or ecosystem and have naturally evolved and adapted to that specific environment over a long period. These animals play integral roles in their ecosystems, and their presence is often tied to the overall
         health and balance of the local environment.Sri Lanka, being an island nation with diverse ecosystems, is home to a variety of indigenous animals.Some of these species are found only in Sri Lanka and contribute to the country's unique biodiversity.
         Here are a few notable indigenous animals.</p>

         <p>Sri Lanka, being an island surrounded by Indian Ocean is the major reason behind the existence of higher
             amount of endemic animal species which is also one of the highest rates of biological endemism in the world. 
             Sri Lanka is home to about 21 species of endemic mammals, 26 species of birds, 113 species of reptiles, 112
              species of amphibians, 50 species of fish and numerous insect species including 24 species of endemic butterflies
               such as Mycalesis rama and Elymnias singhala. Sri Lankan junglefowl, Purple-faced langur and Sri Lanka blue magpie
                are some of common endemic animals that can be observed. Distribution of these animals throughout the country vary
                 according to the ecosystem diversity in Sri Lanka. Sinharaja Rain forest is an ecosystem with one of the highest
                  rate of endemism being the only location where 21 out of 26 endemic bird species can be observed.</p>
