<h1>Sri Lankan Leapord</h1>
<p>The Leopard (Panthera pardus, Linnaeus, 1758) is the most secretive and elusive of the large carnivores, and also the shrewdest. Pound for pound, it is the strongest climber of the larger cats and is capable of killing prey far larger than itself. However, the leopard is the smallest member of the genus Panthera, which includes the Lion, Tiger and Jaguar. Historically, the leopard had a wide distribution across eastern and southern Asia and Africa, from Siberia to South Africa, with fragmented populations in the Indian subcontinent, Sri Lanka, Indochina, Malaysia, Indonesia and China. Sadly, the range has decreased radically due to over hunting and loss of habitat.
    After Linnaeus published his description of leopards in the Systema Naturae in 1758, as many as 27 subspecies of leopards were described within a period of 162 years (1794 to 1956), by various scientists. 
    In 1996, according to genetic (DNA) analysis, nine subspecies are recognized; Panthera pardus pardus (Linnaeus, 1758): Africa, Panthera pardus nimr (Hemprich & Ehrenberg, 1833): Arabia, Panthera pardus saxicolor (Pocock, 1927): Central Asia, Panthera pardus melas (Cuvier, 1809): Java, Panthera pardus fusca (Meyer, 1794): Indian sub-continent, Panthera pardus delacourii (Pocock, 1930): southeast Asia into southern China, Panthera pardus japonensis (Gray, 1862): northern China, Panthera pardus orientalis (Schlegel, 1857): Russian Far East, Korean peninsula and north-eastern China and Panthera pardus kotiya (Deraniyagala, 1956): Sri Lanka, this subspecies is endemic to the island.</p>

        <p>The leopard, a majestic wanderer of the wild</p>
     </section>

<p>The Sri Lankan leopard is known for its distinct appearance, characterized by a relatively short and dark golden-yellow coat with large dark spots and rosettes. These leopards are adapted to the diverse habitats found in Sri Lanka, including grasslands, scrublands, and rainforests. What sets them apart is their adaptation to a predominantly arboreal (tree-dwelling) lifestyle, which is relatively uncommon among leopard subspecies. They are skilled climbers and are known to take refuge in trees, possibly to escape 
    predators or to stash their kills away from scavengers.Unfortunately, the Sri Lankan leopard is currently facing threats such as habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict, leading to a decline in their population. Conservation efforts are being made to protect and preserve this unique subspecies.</p>

                    <p>Yala National Park in Sri Lanka is known for its population of leopards, and it is one of the best places 
                        in the world to spot these elusive big cats in the wild.Yala National Park has one of the highest leopard 
                        densities in the world. Leopards in Yala inhabit various ecosystems within the park, including dense scrub jungles,
                         open savannahs, and coastal areas. They are adaptable and 
                        can thrive in a variety of environments.</p>

                        Wilpattu National Park in Sri Lanka is another important area where leopards can be found. The Sri Lankan 
                        leopard (Panthera pardus kotiya) is the specific 
                        subspecies of leopard that inhabits Wilpattu and other parts of the country.Wilpattu National Park provides a
                         suitable habitat for these leopards, and they are often spotted by visitors during safari tours. The park's varied landscape,
                          which includes dense jungles, scrublands, and numerous
                         water bodies like lakes and ponds, creates an ideal environment for leopards.</p>

                        Leopards do inhabit Kumana National Park, and visitors may have the opportunity to spot them during their visit. The park's diverse ecosystem, which includes dense forests, grasslands, and wetlands, provides suitable habitat for leopards and other wildlife.</p>

        <h1>Threats that leopards face in Sri Lanka</h1>
        <img src="leopardartintro.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Leopards in Sri Lanka, like many wildlife species around the world, 
            face a range of threats that jeopardize their survival and well-being. The island nation's leopards, a
             subspecies known as Panthera pardus kotiya, confront challenges primarily stemming from human-induced activities.
              Habitat loss and fragmentation, driven by factors such as deforestation and urbanization, disrupt the natural
               landscapes crucial for leopard survival. Additionally, poaching and illegal wildlife trade further exacerbate 
               the precarious status of these magnificent predators. The consequences of these threats extend beyond the leopards 
               themselves, impacting ecosystems, biodiversity, and human-wildlife interactions. This introduction highlights the
                urgency of addressing these threats and the importance of implementing effective conservation measures to secure
                 a sustainable future for Sri Lanka's leopards. </p>

          <h2> Poaching and Illegal Wildlife Trade</h2>
          <p>Leopards are targeted for their skins, bones, and other body parts, driven by demand in illegal wildlife trade. 
            Poaching poses a severe threat to leopard populations in Sri Lanka, as it not only directly impacts the individuals
             hunted but also disrupts the overall ecological balance. Enforcement of wildlife protection laws is crucial to combat
             this threat and ensure the survival of leopards in the wild</p>
             <p>Population Decline:
                Consequence: Poaching contributes to a decline in leopard populations as individuals are targeted for their skins, bones, and other body parts, reducing overall numbers in the wild.
                Disruption of Social Structure:
                Consequence: Frequent poaching can disrupt the social structure of leopard populations, leading to imbalances in age and gender ratios. This can impact breeding dynamics and overall population health.</p>
                <p>Strengthened Law Enforcement:
                    Mechanism: Enhance anti-poaching efforts through increased patrols, surveillance, and intelligence gathering. Implement stricter penalties and law enforcement measures to deter poachers and wildlife traffickers.
                    Community Engagement and Education:
                    Mechanism: Engage local communities in conservation efforts, providing education on the importance of leopards and the negative impacts of poaching. Encourage communities to report illegal activities and involve them in alternative livelihood programs.</p>

          <h2>Habitat Loss and Fragmentation</h2>
          <p>Deforestation and conversion of natural habitats into agricultural lands, human settlements, and infrastructure
            development contribute to the loss and fragmentation of leopard habitats. As their territories are reduced and become
            isolated,leopards face challenges in finding sufficient prey, leading to increased human-wildlife conflict.</p>
            <p>Reduced Habitat Availability:
                Consequence: Shrinking natural habitats limit the available living spaces for leopards, leading to increased competition for resources and potential conflicts with other individuals.
                <br>Genetic Isolation:
                Consequence: Fragmentation isolates leopard populations, reducing genetic diversity. Inbreeding becomes a concern, potentially compromising the overall health and adaptability of the species.
                <br>Increased Human-Wildlife Conflict:
                Consequence: Habitat loss pushes leopards to venture into human-populated areas, resulting in conflicts as they prey on livestock. This poses threats to both leopards and local communities.</p>Protected Area Expansion:

                Mechanism: Establish and expand protected areas to preserve critical leopard habitats. This includes creating wildlife corridors to connect fragmented areas and facilitate natural movement.
                Habitat Restoration Programs:
                Mechanism: Implement habitat restoration projects to reclaim and rehabilitate degraded areas, ensuring the availability of diverse and suitable habitats for leopards.</p>
